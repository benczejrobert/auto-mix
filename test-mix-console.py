# TODO make another class for the feature extraction because such a class wouldn't necessarily be project specific HERE

# todo add some global dict that contains the normalization values for the parameters -
#  this will be added to the init with setattr and a for loop

# todo also add the file paths for the input and output signals
#  also add the sample rate

# The diff maker and the feature extractors will load the stuff from the 'global' params

# TODO make a (global) param that allows for choosing if diff is feature based or signal based
#  if it's feature based:
#       1) extract features from signal
#       2) diff features
#  if it's signal based:
#       1) the diff maker will be used on the signal
#       2) extract features from the diff

# TODO maybe add a functionality that allows the user to limit the duration of
#  the input signal to like... 2-3-5 min whatever
